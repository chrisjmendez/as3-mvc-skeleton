AS3 Model View Controller Walking Skeleton for Flash (not Flex)
================

These files are boilerplate pieces of code for Flash Professional users who want to leverage the power of Flash Builder but not look like a weird Flex application. 


There are two folders: /MVC skeleton and /MVC skeleton with composite views. I'd probably start with the composite views first and see if you'd prefer to strip things down even further.
